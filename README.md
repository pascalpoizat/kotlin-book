examples in "Kotlin in Action"

The examples can be tried as follows:
- for a main, by compiling and running the program
- else, by using the Kotlin REPL, e.g.,
    ```kotlin
    import chapter2.Person
    val person = Person("Bob", true)
    println(person.name)
    ```

- [x] chapter 2 (basics, `val` vs `var`, string templates, value-object classes, enums, smart cast with `is`, ranges, conditionals including `when`, loops, exceptions)
